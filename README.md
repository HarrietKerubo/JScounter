# JScounter
This simple Javascript web application logs the number of passengers that get into a vehicle and saves the records 

**Lessons Learnt**

I built this app following a tutorial by Per Harald Borgen on Free Code Camp. I am in the process of learning JS and so far, this is what I have learnt by building this application:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; â€¢	Variables <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;â€¢	Playing with numbers <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;â€¢	String <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;â€¢	Document Object Manipulation (DOM) â€“ the simplest explanation I have got so far was Perâ€™s ðŸŽ‰ <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;â€¢	Functions <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;â€¢	InnerText and textContent and why so far, Per and I prefer textContent <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;â€¢	getElementbyId() <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;â€¢	And using console.log() to run some tests on the JS code <br/>
